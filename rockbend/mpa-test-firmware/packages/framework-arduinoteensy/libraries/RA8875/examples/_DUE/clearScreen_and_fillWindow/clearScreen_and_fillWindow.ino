/*
fillWindow will fill the active window (set by setActiveWindow) with a choosed color. 
When you first start up, the active window it's the whole screen so it acts as clearSceen.
This is the fast way to clear the whole screen or a part of it!
The clearScreen command it's a combination of setActiveWindow(whole)->fillScreen->setActiveWindow(as it was)
so it's much slower, use it when you are using setActiveWindow.
