/*
 * BigNums
 *
 * This sketch demonstrates how to use text areas, some of the large number
 * fonts, and the Printf() formatting function.
 *
 * Note: Printf() uses about 1.8k of code space. It can be expensive
 * if simple strings are being printed relative to using other simpler/smaller
 * functions such as Puts() or the Arduino Print class.
 * However, when doing doing lots of formatting or using hex number output
 * the printf function can be smaller.
 *
 * To save code space, try not to use both the arduino print class and
 * Printf().
 *
 * To save RAM space,
 * keep in mind that if using Printf() the formatting string will consume
 * RAM space.
 * (Normal strings get copied to RAM so you can modify them)
 * Same is true when using Puts()
 * To avoid this, you can delcare your strings to only be in AVR
 * progrmm memory by using the PSTR macro.
 * but then you have to also use the Print_P() or Puts_P() functions instead.
 * Example:
 *
 * GLCD.Printf_P(PSTR("format string"), arg1, arg2, ...);
 * It can also be used for simple strings too:
 * GLCD.Printf_P(PSTR("Hello world"));
 * GLCD.Puts_P(PSTR("Hello world"));
 *
 * The fixnums fonts are not complete fonts. The font headers only contain
 * the characters:
 * '+', ',', '-', '.', '/', '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '9'
 * There are no other characters other than those listed above, so if you
 * try to draw something else like say an 'V', 'F', 'C', or anything
 * not listed above, it will not draw anything for that character.
 *
 * This is intentional to create the possiblity of having large numbers but
 * not eat up lots of flash space.
 * This should be enough to do things like a clock or numbers
 * for things like counters, displaying voltage or temperature, etc...
