@note
While openGLCD shares a common ancestry with GLCDv3, openGLCD is a separate derivative work,
licensed under GPLv3 whereas GLCDv3 was licensed as LGPL v2.1 or later.
As such, projects that use openGLCD that are conveyed (shared/distributed) to others
must be open source licensed under the same terms
and may only use other libraries that are fully compatible with GPLv3.

.i.e.  LGPL v2.1+ code can be used in closed source and GPLv3 projects
but projects that are to be conveyed (shared/distributed) to others,
code from GPLv3 projects can only be used in open source projects that
only use code that is compatible with GPLv3.\n
For a full GPL/LGPL compatibilty matrix see:
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility">GNU license compatibility matrix</a>\n

Furthermore, none of the code, including any additions and improvements in openGLCD over GLCDv3 can
be moved back into GLCDv3 or into any other LGPL, BSD, or closed source compatible licensed project or library
without violating the GPLv3 licensing terms.\n
