REM # Windows batch file wrapper to create openGLCD distribution zip image.
REM #
REM # This batch file looks for the unix tools, adds their path
REM # to the PATH variable, than calls a unix based tool
REM # to do the work to build the zip.
REM #
REM # Needed Tools:
REM # -------------
REM # you must have a commandline VCS tool:
REM #   GIT: http://git-scm.com/download/win
REM #	SVN: http://www.open.collab.net/downloads/subversion/
REM #
REM # you must have 7zip installed.
REM #	http://www.7-zip.org/
REM # 	Make sure to manually add the install dir to your path as the
REM #	default install does not do this.
REM # 	normally it is: $SystemDrive:\Program Files\7-Zip
REM #
REM # you must have doxygen/doxywizard installed.
REM #	http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html#latestsrc
REM #	(Make sure to have version 1.6.3 or later)
REM #
REM # you must either put your openGLCD develoment directory in the Arduino
REM #	distribution "libraries" directory or install WinAVR.
REM #	This is because this batch file attempts to locate a unix tools directory
REM #	and can locate one in the arduino install area.
REM #	Alternatively, you can define WINAVR_UTILDIR in your windows enviroment to
REM #	point to the unix tools directory
REM #	If you install WinAVR or properly define WINAVR_UTILDIR, 
REM #	then this batch file and
REM #	the supporting bash shell script can be located anywhere and do not
REM #	depend on any other s/w other than those mentioned above.
