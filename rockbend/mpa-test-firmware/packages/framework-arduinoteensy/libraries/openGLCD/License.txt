While openGLCD shares a common ancestry with GLCDv3,
openGLCD is a separate derivative work,
licensed under GPLv3 whereas GLCDv3 was licensed as LGPL v2.1 or later.
As such, projects that use openGLCD that are conveyed (shared/distributed)
to others must be open source licensed under the same terms
and may only use other libraries that are fully compatible with GPLv3.

For a full GPL/LGPL compatibilty matrix see:

Furthermore, none of the code, including any additions and improvements in
openGLCD over GLCDv3 can be moved back into GLCDv3 or into any other LGPL, BSD,
or closed source compatible licensed project or library
without violating the GPLv3 licensing terms.
