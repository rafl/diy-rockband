# A resource for playing Rock Band games in 2020

I'm using this repository to collect and share information vaguely related to
various ways of playing the Rock Band series of games from Harmonix on
different platforms and with different peripherals.

So far it mostly details what I know about the Mad Catz MIDI Pro Adapter, and
includes a hardware design and software to build custom game peripherals based
on either emulating the MIDI Pro Adapter or by interfacing with an existing
game peripherals.

I'm hoping to include more information on other peripherals as well as software
to emulate and/or interface with more of them in the future.

## Kudos
